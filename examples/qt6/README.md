# Qt6 Example

This does not build with `cxx` yet, but it does build with `build.sh` on Arch Linux.

`cxx` supports Qt5, if it comes with `pkg-config` (`.pc`) files.

On Arch Linux, Qt6 does not come with `pkg-config` files, but there is CMake configuration.

`cxx` will support Qt6 in a later version. It's a work in progress.
