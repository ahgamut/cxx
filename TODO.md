# TODO

- [ ] Caching the pkgfile / apt-file results while running.
- [ ] Stop the linker error output after the first error, if possible. Send a patch upstream, if need be.
- [ ] `sm get` for downloading dependencies by looking up the missing filename online somewhere, then installing the package with the package manager.
- [X] `sm fmt` for running clang format.
- [ ] Add support for a `doc` directory that will be installed to the right place upon installation.

### Some day

- [ ] Support spaces in directory names.
- [ ] Support spaces in source file names.
